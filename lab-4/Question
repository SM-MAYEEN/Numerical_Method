y 600 500 400 350
4. Write a program to solve the following Differential Equation by using Euler’s method.
dy / dx = x 3 + y, y (0) = 1. Compute y (0.02) taking h = 0.01.
5. Write a program to solve the following Differential Equation by using Runge – Kutta method.
dy / dx = x + y, y (0) = 1. Compute y (0.1) and y (0.2) taking h = 0.1.
